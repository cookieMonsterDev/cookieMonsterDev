## Hi there üëã

I'm Mykhailo. I have over 3+ years of experience in the IT sphere. My journey began as a mere QA
engineer, and now I can proudly call myself a Full-stack Developer. My experience speaks for itself; I
have knowledge not only about developing products but also about testing them, which is a
significant advantage. I believe this background helps me make fewer bugs, or at least I hope so!
Throughout these years, I have worked with many technologies, some of which are listed below. My
main plan for the future is to continue growing and developing myself further as a developer. I hope
this small introduction helps you get to know me better.
